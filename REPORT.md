## Final Project 
The benefits of prototyping with code is that its often possible to quickly change the behaviour of the prototype. As an example there is the arduino prototype with a motor that rotates styrofoam balls. By just altering some numbers in the code the movement can quickly be changed from swiping back and forth at 180 degrees to a constantly rotating movement of 360 degrees. The pace of the movement can be changed aswell as delays and the preset different timings. Its possible to prepare different code snippets, sending it to the arduino board and change the prototype quickly. Arduino is really good for making wireless experiences with automatic functions. We thought of making some user testing with experience prototyping, having users test our prototypes in different locations, carrying the prototype with them and the arduino connected to a USB. Without code and electronics we couln't have created this experience with a self-contained prototype that can create movement by "itself" with a motor controlled by the code in the microprocessor. But occassionally it was so much faster to create the same result by just putting a styrofoam ball on a stick and move it manually. Less materials were required and movement patterns could be changed in no time. The automatic and remote functionality got lost though.

The interface above displays the change of the lock between being locked and unlocked. I used the web sockets for creating the remote features to controll
what happened on the user's screen. The purpose of the prototype
was to represent the concept of the connected car keys, that show when someone else is using the car (locking and unlocking the car). I wanted to communicate the concept to users and get their thoughts and feedback on it. If possible also explore the user experience of this concept.

The UI design effects the experience of the user a lot. I created the toggle switch because it indicates a well known affordance and feedback for on/off or inactive/activated. The purpose was to reinforce the feeling of the remotly controlled activity in the webbrowser. Just an automaticly altering image, could have been perceived as a gif file or similar. During the user test I mostly got feedback on the experience of the UI design and the interaction with the interface. It was easier for the users to relate to this experience and come up with ideas on how an potential app could be designed. I had to ask leading questions, to make the users reflect on how they experienced the concept. Meaning how would they feel about getting the information about when someone else is locking or unlocking their car. What did they think about it? 

I still got my findings. But the findings on what I intended to explore with the prototype were still a lot fewer then the feedback I got for the design of the user interface. It was helpful to use a digital material to represent our design idea and to test it on users. Making the interface controlled remotely enables the designer to adapt the user test spontaneously during the test. I assume that most probably a prototype that looks more like a car key would have put the users more directly in the context of the use situation. But there would still have been a lot of explanation to do about the scenario and concept. I wanted to make the representation of the concept as simple as possible.
